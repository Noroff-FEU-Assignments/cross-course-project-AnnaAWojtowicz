    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">Well, the potential client should be aware that it is important to be proactive rather than trying to limit the damages caused by flawed security.
        As mentioned in the Web Security lesson, there are some methods that can be applied to prevent web security threats. Those are:
        -   	sanitization of data in form of accepting the data that is in the right format;
        -   	using protocols or frameworks for authorization and authentication; using trusted and acclaimed software;
        -   	using CI/CD that controls the security of implemented submissions before they are send to production;
        -   	protecting the data while it's transferred across the network and
        -   	application of automatic timeout in case when users left their sensitive data hanging for too long in the browser.
