## Project Description
*SquareEyes* enable the users to search, browse and chose a film they are interested in. They have a possibility to create or sign in to their account and purchase films they want to watch. 

The project has been created with the help of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

The API to The Movie Data Base (DMTB) was used to get necessary film data to the project. 

Since *SquareEyes* is a schhol project that was handed in whinin a certain deadline, there is still many things that should be improved in the future. Here are some of the function that will be implemented in the near future:
- replacing the most of HTML-code with JavaScript so that the website can be responsive;
- extending the use of API and JavaScript to get necessary information (e.g. flitring or searching after cathegories);
- creating a responsive user profile so that the client can create and reset a password, administer their account and puchase the films.

## Built With
